# Movie Recommendation System

This Python script implements a movie recommendation system using content-based filtering with cosine similarity. The system suggests movies similar to a given movie based on their descriptions or features.

üé¨ How it Works
This recommendation system operates on the principle of content-based filtering. It calculates the similarity between movies based on their features such as genres, actors, directors, and other metadata. The main steps involved are:

Data Collection: The system requires a dataset of movies along with their features. This dataset can be obtained from various sources like IMDb, Kaggle, or other movie databases.

Feature Extraction: Features such as genres, actors, directors, and plot keywords are extracted from the dataset for each movie. This process involves cleaning and preprocessing the data.

Vectorization: The extracted features are then converted into numerical vectors using techniques like one-hot encoding or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is calculated between the vectors of movies. This metric measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, determining their similarity.

Recommendation Generation: When a user provides input (a movie they like), the system finds movies with the highest cosine similarity to the input movie and recommends them to the user.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
To run the movie recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Movie-Recommendation-System.git

2. Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the System: python app.py

üìã Requirements

1. pickle
2. streamlit
3. pandas
4. requests

üöÄ Usage
Input: When prompted, enter the title of a movie you like.
For example: "The Dark Knight"
Output: The system will then recommend a list of similar movies based on cosine similarity.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
Cold Start: This system may face challenges when new movies are added, as it requires existing data to generate recommendations.
Overfitting: Recommendations heavily rely on the provided features. If a movie's features are not well represented, the recommendations may not be accurate.
